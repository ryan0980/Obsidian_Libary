## Queues - Runtimes

![[Pasted image 20220707201624.png]]

- Queues are easy to implement with Linked Lists.
	- To enqueue, insert at the tail of the linked list
	- To dequeue, remove at the head of the linked list
- Queues can also be implemented using an array.
- Most languages will have 1-2 standard ways of using queues.
	- It is still useful to understand how they are implemented under-the-hood.


**

-   A few different options
    list
	linked list (nodes)
	collections.deque
	queue.Queue
