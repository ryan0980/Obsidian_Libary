# Ch1 Introduction 

## Language = syntax + semantics + philosophy 

## Programming paradigms 

- Imperative programming, OO, functional     programming, logic programming 

## Possible kinds of questions 

- True/false questions; multiple-choice questions 

## You do not need to know 

- Date when a language was designed 

# Ch2 Grammar 

## BNF grammar (CFG) 

- Terminals, nonterminals, production rules, start     symbol 

- Derivation, left-most vs. right-most derivations, parse     tree 

## Ambiguity 

- Definition 

- Removing operator ambiguity 

- Adding explicit parenthesis 

- Design a new grammar to enforce associativity and     precedence rules 

- Ambiguous grammar + informal spec. of associativity and     precedence rules 

# Ch2 Grammar 

### E-BNF 

- Writing more concise grammars 

- Alternatives, repetitions, optional parts 

- E-BNF is no more expressive than BNF 

- Can always convert E-BNF to BNF Possible questions 

- Given a grammar, write derivations and parse trees 

- Conversion from E-BNF to BNF 

- Design new BNF grammars 

- E.g., given associativity and precedence 

- Decide whether a grammar is ambiguous and explain why 

- Remove ambiguity 

## Ch2 Lexical and Syntactic Analysis 

## Goal: algorithms for constructing a parse tree 

## from input based on grammars 

## Lexical vs. syntactic analysis 

- Lexical analysis: seq of chars to seq of tokens;     guided by regular expressions 

- syntactic analysis: seq of tokens to parse trees;     guided by CFG 

## Ch2 Lexical and Syntactic Analysis 

 Regular expressions 

- epsilon, a, rs, r|s, r* 

- extended regular expressions– r+, r?, [a-z] FSA 

- states, input alphabet, transition function 

- accepting an input 

- deterministic FSA vs. nondeterministic FSA 

- Theorem: each RE corresponds to a deterministic FSA The construction of lexers 

- a single FSA for all tokens; nextToken() The construction of parsers: recursive-descent parsing 

- Limitation: left recursion 

- Left-recursion removal Lexer and parser generators 

## Ch2 Lexical and Syntactic Analysis 

## Possible kinds of questions 

- Write regular expressions for syntax of tokens 

- Given a regular expression, develop an FSA/DFA 

- Conversion form extended regular expressions to     regular expressions 

- Write pseudo code for recursive descent parsers,     given a grammar 

- Left-recursion removal

# Ch3 Names, Scopes and Bindings 

 Syntactic issues for Naming 

- lexical rules Binding: compile time vs. runtime Variable 

- common bindings; naming convention 

- l-values vs. r-values Scope: decides when a name is visible 

- nested scopes 

- “holes” in scopes 

- scope not the same as lifetime Constructs that can introduce a scope 

- Blocks, functions, for-loops, classes, packages (module),     namespace 

# Ch3 Names, Scopes and Bindings 

## Static scoping vs. dynamic scoping 

- Algorithm based on stack of dictionaries 

## Possible kinds of questions 

 •Scoping 

# Comparing the syntax of E-BNF 

# and Regexps 

## They have similar concepts but with different 

## syntax 

## E-BNF 

- Alternative parts in parentheses and separated with     vertical bars 

- <exp> -> <exp> (+ | -) <exp> 

- 0-or-more repetitions in curly braces { } 

- <num> -> <digit> {<digit>} 

- Optional parts in square brackets [ ] 

- <if-stmt> -> if <test> then <stmt> [else <stmt>] 

# Comparing the syntax of E-BNF 

# and Regexps 

## Regexps 

- Alternation: r1 | r2 

- 0-or-more repetition: r* 

- Optional: r? •...
