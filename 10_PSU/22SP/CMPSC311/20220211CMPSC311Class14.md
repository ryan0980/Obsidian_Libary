# Debugging

- 当出现问题时，我就会条件反射地开始挖掘问题所在。检查堆栈痕迹，插入打印语句，调用调试器。等等。但肯只是站着思考，不理会我和我们刚写的代码。我们刚刚写的代码。一段时间后，我注意到一个模式。肯经常会 往往比我先明白问题所在，并突然宣布："我 我知道什么是错的"。他通常是正确的。我意识到，肯正在建立 构建了一个代码的心理模型，当有东西损坏时，就是模型中的一个错误。模型中的错误。通过思考这个问题是如何发生的，他就会直觉到 模型的错误之处，或者是我们的代码不能满足模型的地方。模型。

- When something went wrong, I'd reflexively start to dig in to the problem, examining stack traces, sticking in print statements, invoking a debugger, and so on. But Ken would just stand and think, ignoring me and the code we'd just written. After a while I noticed a pattern: Ken would often understand the problem before I would, and would suddenly announce, "I know what's wrong." He was usually correct. I realized that Ken was building a mental model of the code and when something broke it was an error in the model. By thinking about *how* that problem could happen, he'd intuit where the model was wrong or where our code must not be satisfying the model.
