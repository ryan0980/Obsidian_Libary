## Operating Systems... 10,000-foot view 

- What is an operating system (OS)? 

- Softwarethat manages machine hardwareand provides interface and abstractions     atop which user applications and systems software is built 

- Types of machines/hardware 

- Desktops, laptops, servers, mobile devices 

- Examples of OSs 

- Windows, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, Android, iOS 

- OS dominance by sector 

- Desktop/laptops: Windows > macOS > Linux 

- Server: no reliable source, probably Linux 

- Mobile: Android > iOS     Hardware CPU RAM SSD

## How to run Linux on your machines? 

- Most of you probably run Windows or macOS 

- Thatâ€™s where VMware comes into play

## More on hypervisors 

- There are two types of hypervisors 

- Type 1: runs on bare physical machine 

- Type 2: runs on an operating system 

- Examples of type 2 hypervisors 

- VMware Workstation (Fusion) 

- QEMU 

- VirtualBox 

- Parallels Desktop for Mac 

- UTM 

- Examples of type 1 hypervisors 

- VMware ESXi 

- Xen
