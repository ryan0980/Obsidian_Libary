## UNIX Origins 

- Multics project starts in 1964 

- MIT, General Electric, Bell Labs 

- Project fails but produces many useful ideas 

- Thompson and Ritchie work on Multics 

- Space Travel for Multics (GE-645) 

- Port Space Travel to PDP- 7 

- Build tools, file system for PDP- 7 àUNIX 

- Main attributes of UNIX 

- multiuser-supports multiple users on the system at     the same time, each working with their own terminal 

- multitasking-support multiple programs at a time 

- portability-when moving from hardware to hardware,     only the lowest layers of the software need to be     reimplemented. CMPSC 311 -Introduction to Systems Programming

## Linux Origins 

- GNU àGNU is Not UNIX 

- Free software project started by Richard Stallman in 1983 

- gcc, gdb, bash, emacs, ... 

- GNU also has an operating system kernel, Hurd –not actively developed/used 

- Linux is an operating system kernel 

- Linux kernel + user tools, desktop environment, ... àLinux distribution

## Linux 

- Linux can be viewed as software layers 

- OS kernel --direct interaction with hardware/firmware 

- system calls --interface to the kernel 

- system libraries --wrappers around system calls 

- programming language libraries --extends system libraries 

- system utilities --application-independent tools 

- e.g., fsck, fdisk, ifconfig, mknod, mount, nfsd 

- command interpreter, command shell --user interface (in terminal program) 

- application libraries --application-specific tools 

- applications--complete programs for ordinary users 

- some applications have their own command shells and programming-     language facilities (e.g., Perl, Python, ...)

## Linux distributions 

- Semi-Commercial systems 

- Since 1991 

- Red Hat, SUSE/Novell, Caldera (defunct, SCO), Debian, 

- Mandrake/Mandriva, Slackware, Gentoo, Ubuntu, Knoppix, Fedora, etc., etc. 

- distrowatch.com 

- List_of_Linux_distributions(Wikipedia) 

- Android, since 2003 

---

## Open source 

- Many software systems in use today are distributed as “open source” 

- Open source software is distributed with a license where the copyright allows the user     of the source to review, modify, and distribute with no cost to anyone. 

- Variants of this arrangement allow a person (a) to derive software from the distribution     and recharge or (b) never charge anyone for derivative works.

## Operating Systems 

- Software that: 

1. Directly interacts with the hardware 

- OS is trusted to do so; user-level programs are not 

- OS must be ported to new HW; user-level programs are portable 

2. Manages (allocates, schedules, protects) hardware resources 

- decides which programs can access which files, memory locations, pixels on the screen, etc., and     when 

3. Abstracts away messy hardware devices 

- provides high-level, convenient, portable abstractions 

- e.g., files vs. disk blocks 

CMPSC 311 -Introduction to Systems Programming 

 Reality: an operating system is just another program, but it runs directly on the hardware .... 

---

#### UNIX is an abstraction provider 

- The OS is the “layer below” 

- a module that your program can call (with system calls) 

- provides a powerful API (the POSIX API) 

 a process running your program

- etc. •

- connect( ), listen( ), read( ), write ( ), ... virtual memory 

- brk( ), shm_open( ), ... process management 

- fork( ), wait( ), nice( ), ...

## UNIX as a protection system 

- OS isolates processes from each other 

- but permits controlled sharing between them 

- through shared name spaces (e.g., FS names) 

- OS isolates itself from processes 

- and therefore, must prevent processes from accessing the     hardware directly 

- OS is allowed to access the hardware 

- when user processes run, the CPU in unprivileged (user) mode 

- when the OS is running, the CPU is in privileged (kernel) mode 

- user-level processes invoke a system call to safely enter the OS

### UNIX as a protection system 

 process A(untrusted) 

###### OS 

###### (trusted) 

 process B(untrusted)process C(untrusted) 

###### HW (trusted) 

 a CPU (thread of execution) is running user-level code in process A; that CPU is set to unprivileged mode

### UNIX as a protection system 

 process A(untrusted) 

###### OS 

###### (trusted) 

 process B(untrusted)process C(untrusted) 

###### HW (trusted) 

 code in process A invokes a system call; the hardware then sets the CPU to privileged mode and traps into the OS, which invokes the appropriate system call handler

### UNIX as a protection system 

 process A(untrusted) 

###### OS 

###### (trusted) 

 process B(untrusted)process C(untrusted) 

###### HW (trusted) 

 because the CPU executing the thread that’s in the OS is in privileged mode, it is able to use privileged instructions that interact directly with hardware devices like disks

### UNIX as a protection system 

 process A(untrusted) 

###### OS 

###### (trusted) 

 process B(untrusted)process C(untrusted) 

###### HW (trusted) 

 once the OS has finished servicing the system call (which might involve long waits as it interacts with HW) it: (a) sets the CPU back to unprivileged mode, and (b) returns out of the system call back to the user-level code in process A 

 system call return

 process A(untrusted) 

###### OS 

###### (trusted) 

 process B(untrusted)process C(untrusted) 

###### HW (trusted) 

 the process continues executing whatever code that is next after the system call invocation

## Hardware Privilege Modes 

- A privilege mode is a hardware state that restricts the operations that code 

###### may perform 

- e.g., prevents direct access to hardware, process controls, and key instructions 

- There are two modes we are principally concerned about in this class: 

- user mode is used for normal programs running with low privilege     (alsosystem services that run in “user space”) 

- kernel mode is the operating system running 

- Unrelated to superuser (root, administrator) privileges

## Device Drivers 

- A device driver is a software module (program) that 

###### implements the interface to a piece of real or virtual 

###### hardware (often needs kernel mode privilege) 

- e.g., printers, monitors, graphics cards, USB devices, etc. 

- often provided by the manufacturer of the device 

- for performance reasons, the driver is commonly run     within the operating system as part of the kernel     (in kernel space) 

- In the past device drivers were often directly compiled into the     kernel (where extensions to the operating system) 

- required the administrator to re-compile the operating system     when a new device type was introduced 

- each system had a different kernel

## Recompiling Kernels? 

- Recompilation of the kernel is problematic 

- takes a long time 

- requires sophistication 

- versioning problems 

- Solution 1 

- User-space modules -creating user-space programs that     support the operating system 

- leverages protection (against buggy code) 

- allows independent patching and upgrading 

- removes dependency on kernel version (mostly) 

- Problem: performance (interacting with user space is often     much slower than in-kernal operations) 

CMPSC 311 -Introduction to Systems Programming

## Recompiling Kernels? 

- Solution 2:     Kernel modules (AKA, loadable kernel modules) -are     software modules that run inkernel space that can be     loaded (and unloaded) on a running system 

- thus, we can extend the kernel functionality without     recompilation 

- the trick is that the kernel provides generic     interfaces (APIs) that the module uses to     communicate with the kernel 

- this is used by almost every modern OS (OSX,     Windows, etc.) 

CMPSC 311 -Introduction to Systems Programming 

 Tip: if you want to see what modules are running on your UNIX system, use the “lsmod” command.
