### Debugging 

- Often the most complicated and time-consuming part of developing a 

###### program is debugging. 

- Figuring out where your program diverges from your idea of 

what the code should be doing. 

- Confirm that your program is doing what you expect to be doing. 

- Finding and fixing bugs ... 

---

### Think before you debug 

- When something went wrong, I'd reflexively start to dig in to the problem, 

###### examining stack traces, sticking in print statements, invoking a debugger, 

###### and so on. But Ken would just stand and think, ignoring me and the code 

###### we'd just written. After a while I noticed a pattern: Ken would often 

###### understand the problem before I would, and would suddenly announce, "I 

###### know what's wrong." He was usually correct. I realized that Ken was building 

###### a mental model of the code and when something broke it was an error in the 

###### model. By thinking about *how* that problem could happen, he'd intuit 

###### where the model was wrong or where our code must not be satisfying the 

###### model. 

---

### Rubber duck debugging 

- The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in 

###### which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code 

###### by forcing themself to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck. 

---

### Printing/Logging 

- One way to debug is to print out the values of variables and memory at 

###### different points 

- e.g., printf( “My variable value is %d”, myvar ); 

---

### Assert 

- assert() is a function provided by C in which you place statements in code 

###### that must always be true, where the process aborts if it is not 

- Check to make sure your assumptions about inputs/logic are always true 

- Syntax:     assert( expression ); 

Examples: 

 assert( i>= 0 ); // Checks value assert( ptr != NULL ); // Checks non-NULL pointer 

assert( (ptr = malloc(100)) != NULL ); // Confirms malloc successful 

assert( func(10, 20) ); // Confirms function returns 0 

###### Note: These are sometimes called logic or program guards. 

---

## Demonstration function 

 #include <assert.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> 

int factorial( int i ) { 

 assert( i>= 0 ); if ( i <= 1 ) { return( i ); } return factorial(i1 )*i; } 

 int main(int argc, char** argv) { int i = 5; if (argc > 1) { i = atoi(argv[1]); } printf(“Factorial of %d: %d\n”,i , factorial(i)); return( 0 ); } 

---

## Demonstration function 

 #include <assert.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> 

int factorial( int i ) { 

 assert( i>= 0 ); if ( i <= 1 ) { return( i ); } return( factorial(i1 )*i ); } 

 int main(int argc, char** argv) { int i = 5; if (argc > 1) { i = atoi(argv[1]); } printf(“Factorial of %d: %d\n”,i , factorial(i)); return( 0 ); }

### The debugger 

- A debugger is a program that runs your program within a controlled 

###### environment: 

- Control aspects of the environment that your program will run in. 

- Start your program or connect up to an already-started process. 

- Make your program stop for inspection or under specified conditions. 

- Step through your program one line at a time, or one machine instruction at a time. 

- Inspect the state of your program once it has stopped. 

- Change the state of your program and then allow it to resume execution. 

- In UNIX/Linux environments, the debugger used most often is gdb (the 

###### GNU Debugger) and is lldb up and coming (on OSX, Linux, ...) 

---

### gdb 

- You run the debugger by passing the program to gdb 

- This is an interactive terminal-based debugger 

- Invoking the debugger does not start the program, but simply drops you into 

###### the gdb environment. 

$ gdb [program name]

Reading symbols from /home/mcdaniel/src/debugging/debugging...done. (gdb) 

##### You can always get help for any command 

##### in gdb by typing help [command] 

---

### gdb with a user interface 

- You can also get a simple terminal interface 

###### by starting the debugger ... 

- This walks you through the code and makes 

###### debugging easier. The commands are the same. 

- Tools like VS Code integrate the gdb function into 

###### the editor/IDE 

#### gdb -tui 

---

## Running the program 

- Once you enter the program, you must start the program running, using 

##### the run command 

- If you have arguments to pass to the program, simply add them to the 

##### run command line 

 (gdb) run Starting program: /root/project/debugging Factorial of 5: 120 [Inferior 1 (process 149) exited normally] (gdb) 

 (gdb) run 12 Starting program: /root/project/debugging 12 Factorial of 12: 479001600 [Inferior 1 (process 153) exited normally] (gdb) 

---

### Looking at code 

- If want to look at regions of code, so use the list command 

- shows 10 lines at a time, centered around the target 

- you can specify a line number (in the current file), 

- or specify a function name 

- Most commands are aliased with single character (l) 

 (gdb) list 4 1 #include <assert.h> 2 #include <stdio.h> 3 #include <stdlib.h> 4 5 int factorial(int i) 6 { 7 assert(i >= 0); // ** CHECK ** 8 if (i <= 1) { 9 return (i); 10 } (gdb) 

 (gdb) l main 10 } 11 return (factorial(i 1) * i); 12 } 13 14 int main(int argc, char** argv) 15 { 16 int i; 17 if (argc > 1) { 18 i = atoi(argv[1]); 19 } (gdb) 

---

### Breakpoints 

- A breakpoint is a position in the code you wish for the debugger to stop and 

###### wait for your commands 

- Breakpoints are set using the break (b) command 

- Each one is assigned a number you can reference later 

- You can delete the breakpoint by using the delete (d) command 

 (gdb) b factorial Breakpoint 1 at 0x400587: file debugging.c, line 6. (gdb) b 16 Breakpoint 2 at 0x4005db: file debugging.c, line 16. (gdb) delete 1 (gdb) d 2 

break [function_name | line_number] 

delete [breakpoint_number] 

---

### Conditional Breakpoints 

- A conditional breakpoint is a point where you want the debugger only if the 

###### condition holds 

- Breakpoints are set using the cond command 

 (gdb) l 7 7 assert(i >= 0); // ** CHECK ** (gdb) b 7 Breakpoint 1 at 0x6e5: file debugging.c, line 7. (gdb) cond 1 i<=1 (gdb) r Starting program: /root/project/debugging 

 Breakpoint 1, factorial (i=1) at debugging.c:7 7 assert(i >= 0); // ** CHECK ** (gdb) c Continuing. Factorial of 5: 120 [Inferior 1 (process 157) exited normally] (gdb) 

cond [breakpoint_number] (expr) 

---

### Conditional Breakpoints 

- A conditional breakpoint is a point where you want the debugger only if the 

###### condition holds 

- Alternately, breakpoints can be set with if expression 

b [line | function] if (expr) 

 (gdb) l 7 7 assert(i >= 0); // ** CHECK ** (gdb) b 7 if i<=1 Breakpoint 1 at 0x6e5: file debugging.c, line 7. (gdb) r Starting program: /root/project/debugging 

 Breakpoint 1, factorial (i=1) at debugging.c:7 7 assert(i >= 0); // ** CHECK ** (gdb) c Continuing. Factorial of 5: 120 [Inferior 1 (process 165) exited normally] (gdb) 

---

### Seeing breakpoints 

- If you want to see your breakpoints use the _info breakpoints_ command 

- The info command allows you see lots of information about the state of your 

###### environment and program 

 (gdb) info breakpoints Num Type Disp Enb Address What 1 breakpoint keep y 0x00000000000006e5 in factorial at debugging.c:7 2 breakpoint keep y 0x000000000000075c in main at debugging.c:22 (gdb) 

 (gdb) help info Generic command for showing things about the program being debugged. 

 List of info subcommands: 

 info address -Describe where symbol SYM is stored info all-registers -List of all registers and their contents info args -Argument variables of current stack frame ... 

---

### Saving breakpoints 

- You can save breakpoints to a file for use later using save command 

- You can load the breakpoints from a file later using source command 

 (gdb) b factorial Breakpoint 1 at 0x6e5: file debugging.c, line 7. (gdb) b 22 Breakpoint 2 at 0x75c: file debugging.c, line 20. (gdb) save breakpoints bpoints.txt Saved to file 'bpoints.txt'. (gdb) 

 root@a2354b724f6e:~/project# gdb debugging (gdb) source bpoints.txt Breakpoint 1 at 0x6e5: file debugging.c, line 7. Breakpoint 2 at 0x75c: file debugging.c, line 20. (gdb) 

---

### Watchpoints 

- Watchpoints (also known as a data breakpoint) stop execution whenever the 

###### value of an variable changes, without a particular place where it happens. 

- The simplest form is simply waiting for a variable to change 

 (gdb) b main Breakpoint 1 at 0x737: file debugging.c, line 17. (gdb) run 4 Starting program: /root/project/debugging 4 

 Breakpoint 1, main (argc=2, argv=0x7fffffffe718) at debugging.c:17 warning: Source file is more recent than executable. 17 if (argc > 1) { (gdb) watch i Hardware watchpoint 2: i (gdb) c Continuing. 

 Hardware watchpoint 2: i 

 Old value = 5 New value = 4 0x0000555555554753 in main (argc=2, argv=0x7fffffffe718) at debugging.c:18 18 i = atoi(argv[1]); (gdb) 

---

### Examining the stack 

- You can always tell where you are in the program by using the where 

###### command, which gives you a stack and the specific line number you are one 

 (gdb) b 7 if i<=1 Breakpoint 1 at 0x6e5: file debugging.c, line 7. (gdb) run 4 Starting program: /root/project/debugging 4 

 Breakpoint 1, factorial (i=1) at debugging.c:7 7 assert(i >= 0); // ** CHECK ** (gdb) where #0 factorial (i=1) at debugging.c:7 #1 0x0000555555554722 in factorial (i=2) at debugging.c:11 #2 0x0000555555554722 in factorial (i=3) at debugging.c:11 #3 0x0000555555554722 in factorial (i=4) at debugging.c:11 #4 0x0000555555554764 in main (argc=2, argv=0x7fffffffe718) at debugging.c:20 (gdb) 

---

### Climbing and descending the stack 

- You can move up and down the 

###### stack and see variables by using 

###### the up and down commands 

 (gdb) p i $1 = 1 (gdb) up #1 0x0000555555554722 in factorial (i=2) at debugging.c:11 11 return (factorial(i 1) * i); (gdb) p i $2 = 2 (gdb) up #2 0x0000555555554722 in factorial (i=3) at debugging.c:11 11 return (factorial(i 1) * i); (gdb) p i $3 = 3 (gdb) down #1 0x0000555555554722 in factorial (i=2) at debugging.c:11 11 return (factorial(i 1) * i); (gdb) p i $4 = 2 (gdb) down #0 factorial (i=1) at debugging.c:7 7 assert(i >= 0); // ** CHECK ** (gdb) p i $5 = 1 (gdb) 

---

### Printing variables 

- At any point in the debug session can print the value of any variable you want 

###### by printing its value using 

- Dictate the output formatted with o(octal), x(hex), d(decimal), u(unsigned 

###### decimal), t(binary), f(float), a(address), i(instruction), and s(string) 

print[/<format>] variable 

 (gdb) p values $1 = "\ 001 \ 002 \ 003 \004" (gdb) p/x values $2 = {0x1, 0x2, 0x3, 0x4} (gdb) p val1 $3 = 4283787007 (gdb) p/x val1 $4 = 0xff5566ff (gdb) p val2 $5 = 2.45677996 (gdb) 

 int myvalues() { char values[] = { 0x1, 0x2, 0x3, 0x4 }; uint32_t val1 = 0xff5566ff; float val2 = 2.45678; return 0 ; // breakpoint here } 

---

### Examining memory 

- You examine memory regions using the x command 

- Modify the output using a number of values formatted with [oxdutfais] 

###### type and size are b(byte), h(halfword), w(word), g(giant, 8 bytes). 

 (gdb) x buf 0x555555756260: 0xefefefef (gdb) x/8xb buf 0x555555756260: 0xef 0xef 0xef 0xef 0xef 0xef 0xef 0xef (gdb) x/xg buf 0x555555756260: 0xefefefefefefefef (gdb) x buf 0x555555756260: 0xefefefefefefefef (gdb) x &buf 0x7fffffffe5f8: 0x0000555555756260 (gdb) 

 int myexamine() { char *buf = NULL; buf = malloc( 8 ); memset( buf, 0xef, 8 ); return 0 ; // breakpoint here } 

x [/<num><format><size>] address
