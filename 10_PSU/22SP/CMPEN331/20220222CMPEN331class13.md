### Floating-Point Multiplication

![[Pasted image 20220224134113.png]]

The MIPS architecture has only 32 registers.

False

The MIPS add instruction operates on register values as if they were signed integers in 2's complement format.

True

The MIPS addu instruction operates on register values as if they were unsigned integers in binary format.

True

The MIPS addi instruction operates on register values as if they were unsigned integers in binary format.

False

The MIPS arithmetic instructions (add, addi, etc.) all use sign-extension.

False

The MIPS logical instructions (and, andi, etc.) all use zero-extension.

False

The MIPS sll instruction has three register operands - a destination, a source (the value  

to be shifted), and a shift amount.

False

The MIPS srl instruction is suitable for signed integers in 2's complement format, since it acts like "divide by a power of 2".

False

The MIPS sra instruction is suitable for signed integers in 2's complement format, since it acts like "divide by a power of 2".

True

The MIPS procedure call conventions require the first five arguments to be placed in registers $a0, $a1, $a2, $a3, $a4, and any remaining arguments to be placed on the stack.

False

The MIPS procedure call conventions require that a function can only access registers  

and the memory locations between the stack pointer and the frame pointer.

False

The acronym ISA is short for Instruction Set Architecture.

True

The acronym PC is short for Program Counter.

True

The Program Counter indicates how many instructions have been executed.

False

The MIPS assembler instruction (not pseudoinstruction) addi $t1, $t2, 65536 is properly formulated.

False

It would be a good idea to memorize the powers of 2, instead of (mis)calculating them on a test.

False

MIPS is a load-store architecture, which means that only load and store instructions access memory to obtain data. [A different mechanism is used to fetch instructions.]

True

A quantity in memory (byte, halfword, word, double word) is aligned if its memory address is a multiple of its size in bytes.

True

The ________ specifies the operation to be performed.

Opcode

A(n) _________ expresses operations in a concise algebraic form using variables.

High level language

_________ instructions provide computational capabilities for processing number data.

Arithmetic

The entire set of parameters, including return address, which is stored for a procedure invocation is referred to as a _________.

Pop

What is the final value of $pc after an add instruction?

the current value of $pc + 4

Which value is stored in $ra by the jal instruction?

the current value of $pc + 4

The bottom of the stack (the largest value of register $sp) is

0x7ffffffc

The top of the stack (the smallest value of register $sp) i

none of the above

The MIPS text segment contains

instructions

The two MIPS data segments are

Static Data and Dynamic Data

Which of these would not be valid as the address of a MIPS instruction

none of the above - they are all valid instruction addresses, assuming the program is long enough

The execution of an instruction involves multiple stages of operation, including fetching the instruction, decoding the opcode, fetching operands, performing a calculation, and so on.

Pipelining

deals with the potential speedup of a program using multiple processors compared to a single processor. The law indicates the amount of speedup as a function of the fraction of code that can be executed in parallel.

Amdahl's law

Characteristics of Benchmark program

a. It is written in a high-level language, making it portable across different machines.  

b. It is representative of a particular kind of programming domain or paradigm, such as systems  

programming, numerical programming, or commercial programming.  

c. It can be measured easily.  

d. It has wide distribution.

SPEC benchmarks

This is a collection of benchmark suites is defined and maintained by the Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC).
