CPU Clocking

250ps=0.25ns=250* 10^-12 s

cpu time=cpu clock cycles* Clock cycle time=(cpu clock cycles/clock rate)

 CPI Example

A: Cycle time = 250 ps, CPI = 2.0

B time=500, CPI=1.2

CPU time for A is 2.0* 250, 500ps

for b is 1.2* 500ps = 600ps

600/500 is 1.2 times more

Clock Cycle=sum of (CPI* Instruction Count i)
