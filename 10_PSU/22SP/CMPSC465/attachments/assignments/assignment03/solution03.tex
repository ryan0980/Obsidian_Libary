Run the combine step of the divide-and-conquer algorithm for convex hull
on the instance given below. You are given $C_1 = (p_1, p_{10}, p_9, p_3, p_5)$
and $C_2 = (p_8, p_{6}, p_4, p_2, p_7, p_{11})$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the lowest point $p^*$ in $C_1\cup C_2$.
\item Transform $C_1$ into $C_1'$ so that points in $C_1'$ is sorted in increasing angle w.r.t.\ $p^*$.
\item Partition $C_2$ into two lists $C_{2a}$ and $C_{2b}$ so that each list is sorted in increasing angle w.r.t.\ $p^*$.
\item Give list $C_2'$ by merging $C_{2a}$ and $C_{2b}$ so that each points in $C_2'$ is sorted in increasing angle w.r.t.\ $p^*$.
\item Give list $C'$ by merging $C_1'$ and $C_2'$ so that each points in $C'$ is sorted in increasing angle w.r.t.\ $p^*$.
\item Run Graham-Scan-Core algorithm to find convex hull of $C'$.
Show stack operations at each step (to deal with each point). For example,
you need to write like "For $A$: push $A$; pop $B$", which indicates when
you process point $A$, push $A$ into stack and also pop $B$ out.

Given $n$ points $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$ in 2D-plane and a slope $a$, we want to
find two \emph{closest} lines with functions $y = ax + b_1$ and $y = ax + b_2$, $b_1
\leq b_2$, so that all $n$ points are in or on between these two lines.
Construct an algorithm with the time complexity $\O(n)$ and justify your
algorithm. Describe your algorithm~(you do not need to give a pseudo code)
and analyze the running time of your algorithm.

{\bf Solution:} For given $n$ points, let $p_i = (p_{ix}, p_{iy})$ and let $P^* =
\{p_i^* : i = 1, 2, ..., n\}$ be a set of duals of $p_i$. Then, consider the
upper- and lower-envelop of $P^*$, denoted as $UE(P^*)$ and $LE(P^*)$,
	respectively. \\ We now are interested in lines with the fixed slope $a$.
	Since a line $y = ax + b$ corresponds to $(a, -b)$ in the dual plane, the
	desired lines will be on the line $x = a$ in the dual plane. In other
	words, if we let $l_1 : y = ax + b_1$ and $l_2 : y = ax + b_2$, then $l_1^*
	= (a, -b_1), l_2^* = (a, -b_2)$ are on the vertical line $x = a$ in the
	dual plane.\\ If some point $l^*$ lies on $UE(P^*)$, it means that $l^*$ is
	above all lines $p_i^*$ in $P^*$. Thus, by the propery of the duality, all
	points $p_i$ is above the line $l$. Same goes true for the lower-envelope.
	Therefore, if we find two points on the line $x=a$ in the dual plane that
	one is on the upper-envelop and the other one is on the lower-envelop,
	their duals have a slope $a$ and all points $p_i$ are contained between
	them. As we need to find two cloesest lines, therefore, $l_1^* =$ the
	intersection of $UE(P^*)$ and $x=a$, and $l_2^* =$ the intersection of
	$LE(P^*)$ and $x=a$ in the dual plane. In other words, $l_1^* = (a,
			\max_{1\leq i \leq n}(p_{ix} a - p_{iy}))$ and $l_2^* = (a,
			\min_{1\leq i \leq n}(p_{ix} a - p_{iy}))$. Transforming to the
			original plane gives $b_1 = -\max_{1\leq i \leq n}(p_{ix} a -
					p_{iy}))$ and $b_2 = -\min_{1\leq i \leq n}(p_{ix} a -
					p_{iy})$.\\ From this argument, it suffices to construct an
					algorithm to find the maximum and minimum of $p_i.x a -
					p_i.y$. It takes $O(n)$ as we need to iterate once and get
					the maximum and minimum value of them.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points ($p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_n$) in a plane. A point
$p_i \in P$ is \emph{maximal} if no point in $P$ is both above and to the right
of $p_i$. Give a set $P$ with 6 points such that there is only one point on the convex hull
of $P$ but this point is not maximal, and there is only one point that is maximal but not on the convex hull of $P$.
Include a visual illustration of these 6 points and the convex hull.  
Specifically, point out which is the point that is on the convex hull but not maximal, and which
is the maximal point but not on the convex hull.
\item Design an instance of convex hull problem with 6 points, such that if
Graham-Scan algorithm runs on your instance, the sequence of stack operations
is (push, push, push, push, pop, push, pop, pop, push).
Include a visual illustration of these 6 points and the convex hull.  
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Solution:}
\emph{Both of these parts can have multiple viable solutions}. Below are simply example answers for these two parts, respectively.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 

    $p_1$ is the point that is on the convex hull but not maximal. $p_6$ is the maximal point that is not on the convex hull.\\
    Thinking process: As we know from class, we need at least 3 points to form a convex hull. So, to find these 6 points, we start with the simplest setting i.e. to find 4 points with one maximal but non-convex point and one convex but non-maximal point. Then, we add 2 other points that don't break the requirements we fulfilled with those 4 points earlier.

    \filldraw[black] (2,1.5) circle (1.5pt) node[anchor=north]{$p_6$};
    \end{tikzpicture}

    \item 

    Thinking process: Based on the Gramham-Scan-Core pseudo-code covered in class and the stack operation sequence, we can deduct the positional relationship between these 6 points.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Since the 4th operation is push, $p_2 \to p_3 \to p_4$ is "turning left".
        \item Since the 5th operation is pop, $p_3 \to p_4 \to p_5$ is "turning right".
        \item Since the 6th operation is push, $p_2 \to p_3 \to p_5$ is "turning left".
        \item Since the 7th operation is pop, $p_3 \to p_5 \to p_6$ is "turning right".
        \item Since the 8th operation is pop, $p_2 \to p_3 \to p_6$ is "turning right".
        \item Since the 9th operation is push, $p_1 \to p_2 \to p_6$ is "turning left".

You are given $n$ points $P = \{ p_1, p_2 , \cdots, p_n \}$ on 2D plane, represented as
their coordinates. You are informed that the convex hull of $P$ contains 
$O(\sqrt{\log n})$ points in $P$.  Design an algorithm to compute the convex
hull of $P$ in $O(n\cdot \sqrt{\log n})$ time. You may assume that no three points in $P$ are on the
same line.

{\bf Solution:} We first find the point in $P$ with smallest $y$-coordinate, denoted as $p^*_1$.
Clearly, $p^*_1$ must be on the convex hull of $P$. Let $C = (p^*_1)$ store the list of points on the convex hull of $P$ found so far.
Let $p^*_0 = p^*_1 - (1, 0)$ be a virtual point~(not within $P$)
be the point on the left of $p^*_1$.  We then iteratively find all other points on the convex hull of $P$.
In the $k$-th iteration, $k = 2, 3, \cdots$, for each point $p\in P\setminus\{p^*_0, p^*_1\}$,
we compute the angle $\angle p p^*_{k-1} p^*_{k-2}$. We then find the point that maximizes this angle, denoted as $p^*_k$.
Clearly, $p^*_k$ must be on the convex hull of $p$ as well~(\emph{Proof.} line $p^*_kp^*_{k-1}$ is an indicator:
all other points locate at one side of this line). Therefore, we add $p^*_k$ to $C$ and continue to next iteration.
The algorithm terminates when we find $p^*_k$ equals to $p^*_1$.

Each iteration finds a new point on the convex hull and takes linear time.
The total number of iterations equals to the number of points on the convex hull.
Hence, the running time is $O(n\cdot s)$, where $s$ is the number of points on the convex hull.
This algorithm is \emph{output-sensitive}. When there are $O(\sqrt{\log n})$ number of points on the convex hull, as described
in this problem, this algorithm runs in $O(n\cdot \sqrt{\log n})$ time.

\emph{(NOTE: you don't need to submit your solution for this problem.)}
Given two \emph{sorted} arrays $A$ and $B$ of size $m$ and $n$ respectively, and an integer $k$, $1\le k \le m + n$,
design an algorithm to find the $k$-th smallest number in $A$ and $B$.
Describe your algorithm and analyze the running time of your algorithm.
Your algorithm should run in $O(\log(m+n))$ time.
%A trivial algorithm is to merge these two sorted arrays
%and find the median, which takes $O(m+n)$. For example, suppose we have
%$A=[1,3,5]$ and $B=[2,4,6]$ (then $m=n=3$), the median of these two arrays is
%the average of 3(in $A$) and 4(in $B$), that is $\frac{(3+4)}{2}=3.5$. Please
%design a divide-and-conquer algorithm for this problem, which should take only $\log (m+n)$ time.


%Finding the median of two sorted arrays is a special case of finding $k$-th
%smallest value of two sorted arrays. We can get the median by computing the
%average of $\lfloor \frac{m+n+1}{2} \rfloor$-th smallest value and $\lfloor
%\frac{m+n+2}{2} \rfloor$-th smallest value of "merged" $A$ and $B$. 

{\bf Solution:} We cannot afford merging $A$ and $B$, as it takes linear time rather than the desired logarithmic time.
The idea of the algorithm is to reduce $k$ by half using a single comparison.
Specifically, each time we compare $A[mid_1-1]$ and $B[mid_2-1]$, where $mid_1=\min(m,k/2)$
and $mid_2=\min(n,k/2)$. If $A[mid_1-1]>B[mid_2-1]$, we eliminate all the elements
before $B[mid_2]$, because it is impossible for the $k$-th smallest value to be
located before and including $B[mid_2-1]$; otherwise, we eliminate all the elements before
$A[mid_1]$.

Define function find-kth-smallest($A, m, B, n, k$) return the $k$-th smallest
number of $A[0\cdots m)$ and $B[0\cdots n)$.
We assume $A$ and $B$ start with index 0. We also assume $A$ and $B$ represent ``pointers'' to the array,
i.e., we will use $A + 3$ to represents the array shifted 3 elements.
The pseudocode is shown below:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
%\caption{find $k$-th smallest value of two sorted arrays}
{\bf function: } find-kth-smallest($A, m, B, n,k$) \\
\If{$m==0$}{
\Return {$B[k-1]$}
}
\If{$n==0$}{
\Return {$A[k-1]$}
}
\If{$k==1$}{
\Return {$\min(A[0],B[0])$}
}

$mid_1=\min(m,k/2)$, $mid_2=\min(n,k/2)$\;
\If{$A[mid_1-1]>B[mid_2-1]$}{\Return{find-kth-smallest($A, m, B+mid_2, n-mid_2,k-mid_2$)}
}
\Return{find-kth-smallest($A+mid_1, m-mid_1, B, n,k-mid_1$)}
\end{algorithm}


%%The following function finds the median in $A$ and $B$:
%%
%%\begin{algorithm}[H]
%%%\caption{find median of two sorted arrays}
%%{\bf Function2: }Find-median-of-two-sorted-arrays($A, m, B, n$) \\
%%\Return {[find-kth-smallest($A$, $m$, $B$, $n$, $\lfloor \frac{m+n+1}{2} \rfloor$) + find-kth-smallest($A$, $m$, $B$, $n$, $\lfloor \frac{m+n+2}{2} \rfloor$)]/2}
%%\end{algorithm}

In above algorithm, at each recursive level, either $k$ is halved, or one array is
eliminated.  The running time is $T(k)=T(k/2)+\Theta(1)$, which gives $T(k)=\Theta(\log k)$. 
%In Function~2, $k=\Theta(m+n)$, therefore the time complexity is $\Theta(\log(m+n))$.
