\begin{enumerate}
    \item  What are the sources and sinks of the graph?
    \item  Give one linearization of this graph.
    \item  How many linearization does this graph have?
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Solution:} 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sources of a graph do not have any in-edges. So, $A$ and $B$ are the sources. Sinks do not have any out-edges. So $J$, $G$ and $I$ are the sinks.
    \item $(A, B, C, D, E, F, H, G, I, J)$ is one of linearizations. 
    \item It has 356 linearizations. Consider $F$ and $H$; first assume that $F$ is before $H$ in the linearization. What are the possible situations between $F$ and $H$ in the linearization? There are 5 cases:
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item $FH$. Then ${A,B,C,D,E}$ are before it and $G,J,I$ are after it. 
        It is not hard to calculate that the number of linearizations for the former is 16 and the number of linearization for the latter is 6.
        \item $FEH$. Then ${A,B,C,D}$ are before it and $G,J,I$ are after it. 
        The number of linearizations for the former is 5 and the number of linearization for the latter is 6.
        \item $FJH$. Then ${A,B,C,D,E}$ are before it and $G,I$ are after it. The number of linearizations for the former is 16 and the number of linearization for the latter is 2.
        \item $FEJH$. Then ${A,B,C,D}$ are before it and $G,I$ are after it. The number of linearizations for the former is 5 and the number of linearization for the latter is 2.
        \item $FJEH$. Then ${A,B,C,D}$ are before it and $G,I$ are after it. The number of linearizations for the former is 5 and the number of linearization for the latter is 2.
        \end{enumerate}
        Summing them up gives $16\cdot 6 + 5 \cdot 6 + 16 \cdot 2 + 5 \cdot 2 + 5 \cdot 2 = 178$. Don't forget this is under the assumption that $F$ is before $H$, the other way around is symmetric. So the total number of linearization is $178\cdot 2 = 356$.

\q{10}{}
You are in charge of the United States Mint. The money-printing machine has developed a strange bug: it will only print a bill if you give it one first. If you give it a d-dollar bill, it is only willing to print bills of
value $d^2 \mod 400$ and $d^2 +1 \mod 400$. For example, if you give it a \$6 bill, it is willing to print \$36 and
\$37 bills, and if you then give it a \$36-dollar bill, it is willing to print  \$96 and \$97. %(1296 (mod 400) = 96.)

You start out with only a \$1 bill to give the machine. Every time the machine prints a bill, you are allowed to give that bill back to the machine, and it will print new bills according to the rule described above. You
want to know if there is a sequence of actions that will allow you to print a \$20 bill, starting from your \$1 bill. Model this task as a graph problem: give a precise definition of the graph (what are the vertices and edges) involved and state the specific question about this graph that needs to be answered. Give an algorithm to solve the stated problem and give the running time of your algorithm.

\textbf{Solution:} 
$G = (V, E)$.

$V$: we have at most 400 possible bills (includes \$0 bill). We add 400 vertices $V = \{v_1, v_2, ..., v_{400}\}$ to represent these 400 possible bills (e.g. $v_1$ represents \$1 bill, $v_5$ represents \$5 bill, and $v_{400}$ represent \$0 bill which can be generated by giving \$20). 

$E$: we enumerate all vertices to add edges. For each vertices $v_k$, we have $i = k^2 \mod 400$ and $j = k^2 +1 \mod 400$, so we add a directed edge from $v_k$ to $v_i$ and a directed edge from $v_k$ to $v_j$.

Then the problem becomes if there is a path to reach $v_{20}$ from a given vertex $v_1$ in the built graph $G$.

We can apply the \emph{explore} algorithm start from $v_1$ to solve this problem. The running time for applying \emph{explore} algorithm is $O(|V|+|E|)$. The running time for creating vertices and edges is $O(|V|+|E|)$. So the total running time is $O(|V|+|E|)$.
