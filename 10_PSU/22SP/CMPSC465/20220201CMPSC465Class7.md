## Half-plane Intersection

line : y=ax-b (a!= infinate)

蓝色就是upper-envelop
红色就是lower-envolop

## Duality

  def: dual of a point
  p* is the dual line of p, with function y=px\*x -py

  def: dual of a line
  let l be y=ax-b
  we define l* as the dual point of l, with coordinate(a.b)

### Example:

## Property:

  >so (p*)* = p
  and (l*)* = l

  >p is on l if and only if l* is on p*

### Proof:

## Property:
p is above l if and only if l* is above p*
vise versa
