# 20220225465465HW6

Consider this algorithm to find all connected components of a directed graph G: run DFS-with-timing on G to get the postlist (i.e., the list of vertices in decreasing post value), and then use the reverse of the postlist as a “magic ordering” to run the DFS algorithm on graph G. Design an instance to demonstrate that this algorithm is incorrect. Specifically, you will need to give a directed graph, then run above algorithm and show that the resulting visited array does not give the correct connected components of G.
