# Math456/CMPSC456 Homework 1

## Due Jan 19 2020

1. (15 points) Letf(x 1 , x 2 ) =ex^1 −^3 x^2 +ex^1 +3x^2 +e−x^1 .Starting with (0,0), determine the approximation after one step of the Newton’s iteration for the minimization problem: minf(x 1 , x 2 ).

2. (25 points) Computer Problem: Apply the Newton’s method and the modified Newton’s method (J(~xk)≈J(~x 0 )) to the nonlinear equations,

 x^21 −x^22 + 2x 2 = 0, 2 x 1 +x^22 −6 = 0.

with initial guess (-5,-4). With the toleranceT OL = 10−^9 , compare the number of iterations needed before convergence. (Attach the code).
