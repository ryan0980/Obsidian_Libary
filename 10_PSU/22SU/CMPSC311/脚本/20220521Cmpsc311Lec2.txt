<div class="transcript-body" style="height: 191px;"> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="119.73" data-time-end="121.53">Suman Saha: listen to me right now yep.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="126.27" data-time-end="127.41">Suman Saha: Okay, so.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="128.97" data-time-end="130.74">Suman Saha: What I was saying that.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="132.09" data-time-end="136.23">Suman Saha: The previous class was some introductory class.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="137.34" data-time-end="144.24">Suman Saha: And this class is kind of introductory and in this class will talk about virtual missions.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="145.65" data-time-end="165.9">Suman Saha: Since we are going to use virtual machines in this course, so we are not learning, you know different technological background of the virtual machines, we are not learning how it is implemented, how does it work, we are not talking about those things, this is out of scope.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="167.52" data-time-end="176.82">Suman Saha: Since we need a virtual machines for this course so that's why we are talking about a virtual machines, why do we need virtual machines.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="177.09" data-time-end="183.6">Suman Saha: And what type of virtual machine, we are going to use and what is virtual machines so we'll talk about some basic tanks.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="184.14" data-time-end="200.73">Suman Saha: And in this lecture salsa is just introductory class that how we can install virtual machines, so when we have a virtual machine, we can play with you know systems, we can ride different system programs and we'll talk about why we need virtual machines also.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="202.86" data-time-end="205.77">Suman Saha: So what is virtual machines.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part active" data-time-start="207.24" data-time-end="223.92">Suman Saha: So a virtual machine is a computer file and just like another file that we see on our computer our Doc file our image file our audio files video files, so it just like another fans.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="225" data-time-end="228.42">Suman Saha: So here's the mission, but it's a file.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="229.59" data-time-end="239.67">Suman Saha: So, since estimations is be have like a real computers like your laptop smartphone are you know Dexter.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="240.99" data-time-end="250.95">Suman Saha: And it has cto he has memory, it has dicks to store data, and it can connect Internet whenever it nears.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="252" data-time-end="256.53">Suman Saha: Strange there's a file, but it can be have like a competition.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="257.94" data-time-end="267.45">Suman Saha: So we'll see how you know in file can be you know can be you can be used as a computers in this lectures.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="268.56" data-time-end="272.91">Suman Saha: So virtual nation, a set up on your actual mission so.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="277.05" data-time-end="277.35">Suman Saha: I told.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="278.97" data-time-end="281.82">Suman Saha: me later, are they different so different yeah.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="284.76" data-time-end="285.63">Suman Saha: Okay, so.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="289.35" data-time-end="306.6">Suman Saha: As I said that the virtual machine is set up on your actual computers so just imagine that you have a laptops and that laptop has some operating system windows or Linux are MacIntosh operating systems now you are going to install.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="307.62" data-time-end="316.44">Suman Saha: Another mentions a virtual missions are you and you are going to create another virtual machines on your actual missions.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="317.55" data-time-end="320.49">Suman Saha: So, how we can do that will see.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="322.11" data-time-end="332.01">Suman Saha: In this lectures and why do we need a new computers on another computers and we'll see those things, also in this lectures.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="334.8" data-time-end="336.78">Suman Saha: Okay, so let's move on.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="340.05" data-time-end="340.29">Suman Saha: Okay.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="342.12" data-time-end="349.98">Suman Saha: So before jumping to virtual machines will talk about operating systems, again, we are not going to talk about.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="350.49" data-time-end="358.38">Suman Saha: Anything details of adding systems, you guys probably already to operating system course, and you know what is operating systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="359.22" data-time-end="370.92">Suman Saha: And why we should talk about operating system because virtual machines, we know that when we have a computers, when we have a laptops and just an electronic device.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="371.43" data-time-end="384.99">Suman Saha: It has, you know Ram cpu and headaches in just a device it's a physical device So if you don't have operating systems, then you can use that electronic device.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="385.56" data-time-end="398.49">Suman Saha: So operating system is the most essential system soft tears on your competitors so operating system basically deal with all those headers.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="400.29" data-time-end="405.03">Suman Saha: Since we are going to create another missions virtual missions.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="406.11" data-time-end="415.08">Suman Saha: And it might need in operating systems, since it is an opening system that we are talking about operating systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="417.3" data-time-end="427.2">Suman Saha: So an operating system is a system software's that deal with harder, so if you see these blog dragon in the slide.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="428.28" data-time-end="433.74">Suman Saha: So you see that lower back you see so just a minute where's the masses.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="435.87" data-time-end="445.83">Suman Saha: Okay, you see hardware, the hardware is your competitors, it has cpo which has ran it has had base, so this is your headers.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="446.76" data-time-end="465.36">Suman Saha: And the other part, is soccer's the software can be system software software can be user applications, there are some differences between systems after and user applications system software basically deal with systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="466.86" data-time-end="473.16">Suman Saha: On your computer, there are a lot of systems after probably you don't use them, they are running in background.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="474.3" data-time-end="480.54">Suman Saha: There are a lot of utility software, there are various guard those all our systems doctors.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="481.59" data-time-end="490.47">Suman Saha: cleaning the in our heart dates are some you know, taking big backups these are different kind of in our system saboteurs.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="492.15" data-time-end="509.85">Suman Saha: The user applications that is also software, but those are basically used by users may be used by some other application may be used by like the user like you say, for instance browsers they are those are you know.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="510.9" data-time-end="522.09">Suman Saha: User applications, the difference between systems of care and user application is systems after do with stamps and user applications deal with users.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="524.34" data-time-end="525.99">Suman Saha: So, since we are going to.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="527.1" data-time-end="533.43">Suman Saha: Talk about system programming, so we mostly talked about the system software in this course.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="534.6" data-time-end="547.2">Suman Saha: now come to the main point of origin systems so we're here, why operating systems in between system software or is that applications and harder swap it is doing over here.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="548.31" data-time-end="564.48">Suman Saha: So operating, we know that her is so complex and so wrong and so low levels, so it cannot be do by different applications so far stance user applications.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="565.62" data-time-end="577.2">Suman Saha: If if basically you know if you don't have lot of expertise, you probably cannot do it harbors for operating system, basically, make a bridge.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="577.71" data-time-end="585.45">Suman Saha: Between you know other applications and the hires if other applications, who want to do with hires.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="585.93" data-time-end="593.16">Suman Saha: They buck come through operating system they send a request to operating system that I want to write something.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="593.97" data-time-end="606.96">Suman Saha: too hard drive, I want to stretch something from Graham then they come the same that request to operating systems and operating systems do with the high rollers and operating system.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="608.37" data-time-end="628.29">Suman Saha: Give that service to other applications so operating system does all the nasty things over here, as I said that hardware is so complex so raw and so low levels it's very difficult to handle you need to know a lot of things lot of knowledge.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="629.79" data-time-end="650.85">Suman Saha: But nobody systems, helping us to doing Those sort of things so whenever you want to write any system software are any user applications, you probably don't need to know anything about hoarders probably you just need to know how to send a request to operating system to do with Harris.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="653.1" data-time-end="661.95">Suman Saha: So when we talk about operating systems, there are two important things over here, we see those are interface and abstractions.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="663.18" data-time-end="677.1">Suman Saha: So so operating system provides so many interfaces to other applications and we can use those interfaces to do wait havers So what is the interface so, for instance.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="678.09" data-time-end="699.45">
Suman Saha: You build some complex systems, who is going to use that complex system, maybe some users, maybe some people who don't have conversations backgrounds, so you just need to give some way, how they can use your complex systems okay so, for instance, you write some functions.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="700.5" data-time-end="702.84">Suman Saha: And those functions does lot of things.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="704.34" data-time-end="720.48">Suman Saha: And you give the functions headers or functions name to other people, they just call that functions using API it's just you know the API so using the API they use your different complex systems and other steps.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="722.55" data-time-end="728.52">Suman Saha: So these are called interface interface is front view of the.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="729.72" data-time-end="742.05">Suman Saha: You know the other worlds, so if you want to use, something which is so complex, but if you have some from you to use use them that classic interface.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="742.59" data-time-end="764.13">Suman Saha: So, as I said that hardware is so complex it's not easy to use for operating system, giving us a lot of interface, so you can write something to have right using the system call you can face something from that device using that system.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="765.24" data-time-end="772.92">Suman Saha: If they don't provide that system calls then probably you have to do with those things with the horrors which is not easy.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="773.97" data-time-end="785.97">Suman Saha: So this this, this is one of the most important things that operating system provide us the interfaces so using that interfaces we can deal with you know systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="787.53" data-time-end="789.36">Suman Saha: The next one is abstractions.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="791.01" data-time-end="795.48">Suman Saha: If I give you the simple definition of abstractions can I can say.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="796.89" data-time-end="802.17">Suman Saha: abstraction is the simplest way to present complex system.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="803.7" data-time-end="806.46">Suman Saha: simplest way to present complex system.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="807.96" data-time-end="816.45">Suman Saha: You might have lot of you know, huge you know systems so complex systems, but do you have to present them to the.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="817.47" data-time-end="818.4">Suman Saha: end users.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="819.87" data-time-end="822.45">Suman Saha: Who doesn't have any knowledge what is going on inside.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="823.68" data-time-end="831.69">Suman Saha: So you have to find out how you can present those things to end user, so they can understand what is going on.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="833.16" data-time-end="836.34">Suman Saha: let's take this one examples my mobile phone.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="837.54" data-time-end="838.44">Suman Saha: The mobile.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="840.42" data-time-end="849.99">Suman Saha: it's very common devices nowadays anybody can call anybody can send text, they can browse the Internet.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="851.28" data-time-end="855.45">Suman Saha: it's so user friendly so anybody can do anything using mobile.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="857.37" data-time-end="863.67">Suman Saha: But the mobile device the Internet functionality is not normal it's not so simple.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="864.72" data-time-end="871.8">Suman Saha: it's doing a lot of things is doing a lot of communication channels is doing a lot of inner signals and other things.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="872.97" data-time-end="881.43">Suman Saha: But we then need to care about those things as the users, we don't need to know those things we don't need to know how they're dealing with those things.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="882.09" data-time-end="892.68">Suman Saha: We just need to know how to spell we don't need to know how to make a power, how to send text faster as a user I not just need to know those things.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="894.15" data-time-end="900.75">Suman Saha: So the simplest presentations of the move is helping us to use those things.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="901.83" data-time-end="906">Suman Saha: So when you make a complex systems, you have to think.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="907.05" data-time-end="908.43">Suman Saha: How we can present.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="909.48" data-time-end="918.24">Suman Saha: My complex system to the end user, as the simplest manner, so they can use they can learn very easily.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="920.01" data-time-end="937.08">Suman Saha: So operating systems providing some abstractions of our hardware so other users other programmer can our can use our hardware in the simplest way.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="938.34" data-time-end="957.57">Suman Saha: So these are the two important things that we learn from operating systems, whenever we both system software's, we have to think so we we are providing better interface for other users, we are providing better abstractions for other users.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="964.2" data-time-end="972.09">Suman Saha: Okay, so we understood what is operating systems we we knew what is operating system, so we are talking about operating systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="972.96" data-time-end="992.46">Suman Saha: Okay, so how many system disability years on different nations, we know that those are dicks travel APP servers mobile phones, those are using different operating systems and nowadays we see, there are different type of operating systems windows MacIntosh when asked.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="993.63" data-time-end="995.94">Suman Saha: Previously android and ios.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="997.02" data-time-end="1016.31">Suman Saha: And we see that most of the people are using you know windows operating systems and they use some lot of people use MAC ways also and some people's use Linux there are some people in this world, they use Linux.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1017.36" data-time-end="1023.36">Suman Saha: And why they use Linux What are those things, what is important over there okay.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1024.95" data-time-end="1026.96">Suman Saha: Then there are servers.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1028.16" data-time-end="1038.21">Suman Saha: servers visible you're under Linux mostly mostly not all of them, and why servers are basically run by Linux and Linux we'll talk about those things also.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1038.99" data-time-end="1051.86">Suman Saha: And we have mobile phone and mobile phone mainly using android operating systems and ios and android is most popular more popular than ios because android devices are more than ios devices.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1053.72" data-time-end="1058.46">Suman Saha: Okay, so these, this is a story of operating systems now.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1059.57" data-time-end="1060.53">
Suman Saha: come to the Linux.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1061.58" data-time-end="1064.76">Suman Saha: So we understood that we need virtual machines.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1065.78" data-time-end="1087.02">Suman Saha: And why we need we'll talk about those things, and then we we we understood that virtual machines need some operating system that's why we talk about operating systems, now we need to choose one operating systems for our course and we are forcing you to use Linux and why Linux.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1088.43" data-time-end="1092.27">Suman Saha: Let me start the discussions with a with a story my story.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1093.53" data-time-end="1094.94">Suman Saha: When I.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1096.89" data-time-end="1106.34">Suman Saha: joined for PhD I did my PhD from the University of Paris so So when I joined for my PhD and.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1108.2" data-time-end="1116">Suman Saha: Our very first day my supervisor asked me what kind of computer do you need for your research.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1117.02" data-time-end="1118.88">Suman Saha: So he said that.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1120.29" data-time-end="1138.05">Suman Saha: You can have you can you can get normal computers, you can get apple computers, but that time I was young, like you, I see that apple computer is luxury computers kasi computers, so I said that yeah I need apple computers.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1139.28" data-time-end="1147.56">Suman Saha: And she's like he asked me why do you need apple computer I said I don't actually why don't why I need apple computer, but I need to accomplish.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1149.18" data-time-end="1150.38">Suman Saha: Something joining.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1151.61" data-time-end="1158.9">Suman Saha: I saw in my lap my lap basically is a system lab peoples are working in systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1160.64" data-time-end="1167.75">Suman Saha: Most of the people using normal laptops so normal laptop with Linux operating systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1169.91" data-time-end="1180.62">Suman Saha: So, David day I found that so people who are working in systems, who are working in system programming they usually use Linux.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1182.42" data-time-end="1194.12">Suman Saha: So that's why you know my supervisor asked me, since you are going to work on system still you are looking for apple computer not Linux operating systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1195.26" data-time-end="1195.92">Suman Saha: So.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1197.18" data-time-end="1213.23">Suman Saha: Linux operating system is widely used by system programmers people who use systems, who do research, who are doing engineering in systems they basically use Linux, so why Linux.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1215.6" data-time-end="1218">Suman Saha: So, first of all I like to mentions.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1219.14" data-time-end="1232.4">Suman Saha: Linux is open source open source code, so you probably know that what is the difference between open source and close the open source code means you can browse they are so spoke.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1233.51" data-time-end="1238.31">Suman Saha: You can download either you can modify it, you can do an experiment, you can do a lot of things.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1239.6" data-time-end="1241.4">Suman Saha: Okay that's an open source.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1243.44" data-time-end="1252.86">Suman Saha: and close closer smells that you cannot access their source, but say, for instance, Microsoft windows are maquis you cannot see they're so small.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1254.51" data-time-end="1268.4">Suman Saha: company like these companies to be giant company they mostly using Linux operating systems, so they are spending millions and billions of dollars for their company.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1269.45" data-time-end="1271.91">Suman Saha: And they want to create some systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1272.93" data-time-end="1277.94">Suman Saha: If they don't have access to the source code and how they rely on that systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1279.98" data-time-end="1288.29">Suman Saha: them something that they can see, they can experiment with that that system is rely rely ever for their business or not.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1289.43" data-time-end="1295.01">Suman Saha: that's why they go for Linux because they can they can see their you know soda.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1296.42" data-time-end="1305.87">Suman Saha: So that's why that is one of the reasons, most of the big company using Linux operating systems because of you know, open source.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1307.22" data-time-end="1309.62">Suman Saha: The second reason it is free.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1311.42" data-time-end="1316.28">Suman Saha: Just imagine that Amazon is using windows operating systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1317.39" data-time-end="1321.08">Suman Saha: So you can guess that how much money am as a need to pay to induce.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1322.64" data-time-end="1328.49">Suman Saha: say so lots of money and they are competitors, they don't want to give a space to other company.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1330.35" data-time-end="1347.06">Suman Saha: So that's the reasons they don't want to use the operating systems or systems from other companies and they don't want to pay extra money if they have something similar or something better, I would say something better.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1349.16" data-time-end="1350.93">Suman Saha: Which doesn't cost anything.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1353.36" data-time-end="1365.9">Suman Saha: So that is the second reason that is free, the third reason is most important reason is security, so why i'm saying that Linux is more secure than other operating systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1367.94" data-time-end="1371.06">
Suman Saha: As I said that Linux is open source.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1372.98" data-time-end="1389.09">Suman Saha: The security experts who do research to find different security holes from systems, they can see, they can you know analyze Linux source code to find a different security holes.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1390.17" data-time-end="1405.92">Suman Saha: So every month or every day or every year, so lots of people find lots of security holes lots of one more vulnerability from Linux operating systems and those to Linux community and Linux Community fix those things.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1407.51" data-time-end="1413.51">Suman Saha: So there are thousands of people who are paying for Linux to make it more relax.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1416.03" data-time-end="1421.76">Suman Saha: and have a year Linux became so powerful so strong sorry levels now.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1422.78" data-time-end="1429.17">Suman Saha: Is you know, I think that more secure than other applications other some other operating systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1430.25" data-time-end="1433.22">Suman Saha: Now, think of other operating systems, they are closed.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1434.33" data-time-end="1438.83">Suman Saha: Only the people who are working for those company, they can access their sport.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1439.94" data-time-end="1443.81">Suman Saha: So they are knowledge they are expertise are limited.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1445.01" data-time-end="1454.28">Suman Saha: Linux expertise Linux knowledge, people who are working for Linux is unlimited lot of people, so what it means.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1456.35" data-time-end="1468.98">Suman Saha: So that's why people think that Linux is more secure than other applications, because we can see that what is the problem, so when you see the problem we can solve it.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1471.95" data-time-end="1476.03">Suman Saha: Next, one is, I will say that package manager.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1477.35" data-time-end="1484.61">Suman Saha: So if you use any operating systems and, if you want to download something and install it, you need to go through several steps.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1485.72" data-time-end="1499.55">Suman Saha: You have to download it then you have to take some permission from computers, then you have to you know open different you know windows and go click different snakes maybe some other stops also.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1500.6" data-time-end="1502.94">Suman Saha: But only in X is so easy.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1504.35" data-time-end="1514.22">Suman Saha: It just use the same command to install anything so you use single command to download and installs on your competitors.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1515.51" data-time-end="1521.72">Suman Saha: So it's so easy that that people who are working for systems as a system programmers they usually.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1522.95" data-time-end="1542.12">Suman Saha: That they like to use the simplicity, so when the bill some systems they might need different tools they might be different, libraries and then just use that common then download and install it is within you know within a minute or within two minutes, they can download and install it.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1543.17" data-time-end="1544.07">Suman Saha: So that's why.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1545.18" data-time-end="1553.91">Suman Saha: You know the system program are like to use know Linux so because it has very strong password manager package managers.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1555.29" data-time-end="1556.76">Suman Saha: But, finally, I would say that.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1557.93" data-time-end="1566.42">Suman Saha: Linux is more reliable and more starbucks and he doesn't need rebooting most of the times when you install something.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1567.23" data-time-end="1584.15">Suman Saha: If you saw something on Microsoft or any other land operating systems, they will ask you to reboot your competitors are operating system but Linux doesn't need those things, most of the times and it is important for maintaining servers.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1585.32" data-time-end="1587.96">Suman Saha: So servers need to be kept running.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1588.98" data-time-end="1590.69">
Suman Saha: So that's why people.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1592.13" data-time-end="1595.37">Suman Saha: Who are building servers they like to use Linux.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1596.39" data-time-end="1600.68">Suman Saha: In this world there are a lot of servers is running on Linux.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1602.42" data-time-end="1605.93">Suman Saha: You know your by your so they never stopped.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1607.73" data-time-end="1616.79">Suman Saha: So this is the summary, this is the story why people why system programmer use Linux operating systems, since you guys are.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1618.5" data-time-end="1628.85">Suman Saha: going to work on system programming and we prefer and you force you to use Linux you guys go for industry.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1629.39" data-time-end="1646.43">Suman Saha: And you want to work for system programming, you have to use Linux so that's the reason we asked you to use Linux so when you have a virtual machines, you will install Linux operating systems and then you will do all of your system programming.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1647.84" data-time-end="1648.65">Suman Saha: Any questions.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1653.6" data-time-end="1655.07">Suman Saha: Questions No questions.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1661.97" data-time-end="1662.3">Suman Saha: Okay.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1663.92" data-time-end="1664.64">Suman Saha: Now.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1666.2" data-time-end="1666.74">Suman Saha: So.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1667.76" data-time-end="1676.28">Suman Saha: Now tell me not now let me tell you that why we need virtual machines, so you guys use windows operating systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1677.45" data-time-end="1679.46">Suman Saha: Maybe you have MAC os.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1680.48" data-time-end="1686.42">Suman Saha: So, most of the people who use this to one of these two operating systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1687.89" data-time-end="1697.04">Suman Saha: Since we are asking you to use Linux operating systems we you are not going to buy another computers, you are going to use same competitors.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1698.03" data-time-end="1709.37">Suman Saha: So, in order to use another operating systems on your computers, so we need some virtual machines so virtual machines.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1710.24" data-time-end="1727.37">Suman Saha: is amazing that need to be set up on your computers and that virtual machines can have Linux operating systems, and we know that virtual machine work we have like a normal missions, so you will not have any problems so virtual box.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1728.63" data-time-end="1737.42">Suman Saha: Is is a virtual machines and these semesters we are asking you to use virtual box because virtual box is.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1738.5" data-time-end="1739.61">Suman Saha: easy to install.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1740.69" data-time-end="1751.28">Suman Saha: easy to learn or use it's not difficult to you know difficult like vmware to we we heard that vmware is difficult.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1752.09" data-time-end="1764.27">Suman Saha: To installs a lot of people, a lot of students complain last semesters that we are choosing virtual box distance, but if you if you guys, you know already have some virtual machines.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1765.5" data-time-end="1786.74">Suman Saha: Any other machines, maybe, maybe, maybe other things you can use that one we don't have any problems Okay, but if you if you don't have you can choose the virtual box is very easy to install and i'll show you some steps it takes only two meters know some states.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1791.45" data-time-end="1791.75">Suman Saha: Okay.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1793.07" data-time-end="1794.18">Suman Saha: he's a hypervisor.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1797.18" data-time-end="1800.3">Suman Saha: For only things which is well.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1802.49" data-time-end="1802.94">For.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1804.62" data-time-end="1825.62">Suman Saha: Linux yes, no say the Linux easier operating systems and you are doing six products that's the region see that need to build with the headers yeah so you do all the projects on Linux virtual machines, these are the reasons.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1834.83" data-time-end="1836.24">Why, we know.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1845.96" data-time-end="1846.98">Suman Saha: Is super stupid.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1859.7" data-time-end="1863.48">Suman Saha: What people use Linux and you are saying that Linux is a stupid things.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1875.03" data-time-end="1875.51">Suman Saha: Oh.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1880.58" data-time-end="1886.46">Suman Saha: yeah this is this is, this is not for you only so The reason is that.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1888.35" data-time-end="1889.94">Suman Saha: Please, please, please, please.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1891.98" data-time-end="1893.42">
Suman Saha: The reason is that, as I said that.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1894.77" data-time-end="1898.37">Suman Saha: You probably know working for different industries later right.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1899.39" data-time-end="1908.24">Suman Saha: And if you want to work as a system programmer they want you to use Linux so you have to learn, this is a learning phase.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1909.35" data-time-end="1914.96">Suman Saha: Right, this is a learning if you don't like Linux you have to spend more time on Linux.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1915.98" data-time-end="1918.35">Suman Saha: You have to find out why you don't like Linux.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1935.48" data-time-end="1936.29">Suman Saha: do everything.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1941.87" data-time-end="1945.98">Suman Saha: You can do everything on windows, but since we are learning over here.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1947.03" data-time-end="1950.36">Suman Saha: We just want to teach you how to use Linux.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1952.19" data-time-end="1952.64">Suman Saha: yeah.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1956.69" data-time-end="1957.59">Suman Saha: Okay okay.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1960.89" data-time-end="1961.82">Suman Saha: So dance.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1963.38" data-time-end="1964.91">Suman Saha: Students please don't have.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1967.82" data-time-end="1968.12">Suman Saha: Other.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1970.37" data-time-end="1972.23">Suman Saha: Okay, so virtual box.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1973.55" data-time-end="1981.5">Suman Saha: Okay virtual box is a hypervisor So what is hypervisor or sometimes it's called virtual machine monitors.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1982.58" data-time-end="1995.15">Suman Saha: So hypervisor is a software that creates or run different virtual machines on your post missions that means you have a missions.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1996.08" data-time-end="2013.03">Suman Saha: You have emissions and that mission has some operating systems and you are going to install some hypervisor a software and that software will help you to create multiple virtual machines on your host missions.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2014.08" data-time-end="2023.62">Suman Saha: So hypervisor is just say you know virtual machines monitors, so it will create multiple virtual machines and it will run multiple virtual machines.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2027.67" data-time-end="2039.58">Suman Saha: let's see this example, say, for instance, you have a physical machines like your computer laptops and this laptop has cpu Ram headaches and you probably have windows.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2040.21" data-time-end="2053.92">Suman Saha: Right and these windows, you know running different applications like Google chrome or call of duty some applications, and you have another applications and other software's virtualbox.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2055.03" data-time-end="2063.34">Suman Saha: So virtual works is nothing but it just like another applications now virtual box creator's virtual machines.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2064.06" data-time-end="2072.82">Suman Saha: As I said that virtual mission in just like another missions So you see that they have same structure, so what we have the.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2073.18" data-time-end="2089.89">Suman Saha: Actual missions, so the physical mission has CPA or an ssd virtual machine as cpu Ram sst not now cushion can be awry so how these were told, we should get this cpu Ram and ssd.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2091.78" data-time-end="2097.36">Suman Saha: So they basically taking those resources from our actual computers.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2098.5" data-time-end="2106.72">Suman Saha: So our actual computer has as, as do Ram and you know cpu they shared those resources to virtual machines.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2108.49" data-time-end="2114.01">Suman Saha: Let me, let me give you an example, say, for instance, your computer has a gigabyte Ram.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2115.57" data-time-end="2121.6">Suman Saha: And you are running some windows operating systems and windows operating systems using four gigabyte Ram.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2122.68" data-time-end="2124.27">Suman Saha: Now you are going to create.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2125.29" data-time-end="2136.24">Suman Saha: Virtual missions some maximum you can get to virtual machine is four gigabyte Ram because you have only four gigabyte drive other four gigabyte Ram is used by your windows operating systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2137.95" data-time-end="2154.63">Suman Saha: So you have to decide how much resource, I can give to virtual machines, so if you give four gigabyte Ram your virtual machines, say, for instance Linux and if you have four gigabyte of Ram for your windows host operating systems, then you cannot get any other virtual machines.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2155.83" data-time-end="2166.03">Suman Saha: So you have to distribute your resource properly, so you can get multiple virtual machines, because all the resources are coming from your actual computers.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2167.29" data-time-end="2167.65">
Suman Saha: Okay.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2168.76" data-time-end="2170.38">Suman Saha: So when you create.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2171.58" data-time-end="2177.34">Suman Saha: When you create measures you decide how much resources, you are going to give.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2180.82" data-time-end="2188.35">Suman Saha: So then, after virtualization chance you can have some operating systems, we know that mission is operating systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2191.71" data-time-end="2201.73">Suman Saha: missionary some operating systems so virtual machine has operating system Linux and then only knocks you can install some applications.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2203.23" data-time-end="2213.01">Suman Saha: And these applications can be anything so you know that your host computer can install anything so similarly your virtual machine can install anything.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2214.21" data-time-end="2233.02">Suman Saha: So, at the same time, you can have another virtual machine also so that means it's not that you can have one virtual machines, you can have multiple virtual machines and you can have you know different scenario in different virtual machines.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2234.67" data-time-end="2238">Suman Saha: Here one thing I just like to mention that.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2239.95" data-time-end="2257.08">Suman Saha: These virtual machines, although are sitting at the same place, but they don't share anything with each others they are completely different, they they they have different space different are.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2258.37" data-time-end="2259.78">Suman Saha: They burn sure everything's.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2260.89" data-time-end="2263.29">Suman Saha: Just thinking about our cloud computing systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2264.52" data-time-end="2277.51">Suman Saha: aws so aws giving you that facility to create machines virtual machines thousands of people's thousands of programmer create virtual machines on aws.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2278.86" data-time-end="2280.84">Suman Saha: So they don't see each other's.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2283.39" data-time-end="2288.28">Suman Saha: that's why they are so secured so different you know different.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2290.17" data-time-end="2297.97">Suman Saha: So different or so secure so that's why people like to you know have virtual machines on on four different purpose.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2300.16" data-time-end="2312.4">Suman Saha: Okay, so this is the, this is the story of our trauma patients Now the question is the summary why we need another computer on our computers.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2313.12" data-time-end="2331.15">Suman Saha: So we are seeing that we have computers and now we are installing and other computers, we already have saved seven things so I just like to know from you guys, what do you think why we need another computers, on your personal computer yes.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2334" data-time-end="2334.51">Suman Saha: Sorry.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2336.4" data-time-end="2337.51">Suman Saha: Good good yeah.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2341.11" data-time-end="2341.92">Suman Saha: yeah true.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2377.98" data-time-end="2378.28">Suman Saha: yeah.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2380.05" data-time-end="2381.13">Suman Saha: Okay, so.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2382.72" data-time-end="2390.58">Suman Saha: So I just give two more you know, in a similar cases, so you probably need to learn some other operating systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2391.06" data-time-end="2398.23">Suman Saha: And if you want to learn other operating system, you cannot buy another computers, so you can have virtual missions and you can install.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2398.95" data-time-end="2408.67">Suman Saha: You know another operating system, and you can play with that operating system, this is one kings another thing is that, so far, this is, you need to do with some binary data.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2409.9" data-time-end="2428.77">Suman Saha: Some binary source and that deal with some partners and you don't want to mess with your original operating systems, so you can have a virtual machines and whatever you want to do, you can do in your virtual machine operating systems and if something happens you just.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2429.85" data-time-end="2434.5">Suman Saha: You know uninstall it and re installing, it is very simple.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2435.52" data-time-end="2444.19">Suman Saha: So and keeping your origin operating system safe because it's not communicating with your original operating systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2445.21" data-time-end="2454.66">
Suman Saha: So money data some time is not secured if you get data from you know binary source code from other people's other applications sometimes they can have your competitors.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2455.77" data-time-end="2468.4">Suman Saha: So that's why you know destroy your competitive, so we should do all those experiments with those data with those scored in the virtual machines, so we can keep our computer safe.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2471.55" data-time-end="2472.18">Suman Saha: So.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2475.03" data-time-end="2477.46">Suman Saha: So this is our guest operating systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2478.69" data-time-end="2480.7">Suman Saha: And this is our host operating systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2484.3" data-time-end="2491.56">Suman Saha: Virtual machines are hypervisor can be two types Type one and Type two.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2492.7" data-time-end="2499.39">Suman Saha: So far, what we have described, those are called Type two offerings Type two hypervisor.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2500.53" data-time-end="2512.98">Suman Saha: So the hypervisor that you are going to use that would be tied to have advisors, so you have a personal computers and on personal computer you have some operating systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2513.73" data-time-end="2524.5">Suman Saha: And that operating systems on that operating system you install Skype to have advisors and such as virtual box and then you can create multiple virtual machines.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2526.3" data-time-end="2534.61">Suman Saha: By two Type one hypervisor is different type one hypervisor doesn't have you know host operating systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2535.93" data-time-end="2543.94">Suman Saha: So you see overhears the hypervisor is installed on physical missions, there is no operating system so we're here.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2545.95" data-time-end="2552.07">Suman Saha: And after that it's a similar hypervisor is to create fear to run different virtual machines.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2553.42" data-time-end="2564.31">Suman Saha: With companies they use Type one hypervisor aws visit oceans cloud computing systems they use Type one hypervisor.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2565.93" data-time-end="2570.91">Suman Saha: There is some basic benefits so in the type one hypervisor.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2572.32" data-time-end="2582.76">Suman Saha: These are have a flexibility to choose how much resource, they want or they need so when you create some nations in cloud computing you can choose.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2583.72" data-time-end="2595.24">Suman Saha: How many Ram the one how many Ram how many a space, you need how many cpu need you can choose that one you can customize your virtual machines.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2595.72" data-time-end="2610.9">Suman Saha: So that's flexibility gifts given by Type one hypervisor so that's why big companies always use Type one hypervisor but ooh a as a personal users, we are going to use type to have a business.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2612.88" data-time-end="2632.08">Suman Saha: So these are two, these are examples of type two hypervisor you see that vmware rock stations qe meu virtualbox fell Dexter formats are edm So these are some examples of have no time to have advisors.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2633.37" data-time-end="2634.78">Suman Saha: And Type one hypervisor.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2635.83" data-time-end="2642.49">Suman Saha: You know, provided by vmware also that is called vmware as exciting and then said.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2644.53" data-time-end="2647.65">Suman Saha: So these are two types of hypervisor.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2648.82" data-time-end="2658.81">Suman Saha: Now let me tell you some benefit of visualizations are by describing one case studies so, for instance.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2660.13" data-time-end="2668.23">Suman Saha: For instance, the company doesn't have you know virtualization systems or any virtual machines, so they have a sidebar.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2668.86" data-time-end="2685.57">Suman Saha: The mantle one operating systems they install everything they have database, they have data they have lot of things now in their computer crash or fell in their heart they've got fell so everything what they have in the computer.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2686.68" data-time-end="2687.52">Suman Saha: All will be gone.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2689.44" data-time-end="2704.26">Suman Saha: So the start, you know you know these are these are not having virtualization now taka taka taka with the virtualization if you have the virtualization systems in your competitors is just just like a file.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2705.55" data-time-end="2725.77">Suman Saha: You can copy it called snapshot so every night, you can copy that file to other place so when you copy you copy everything you copy all the configuration you copy all the data you copy all the applications, if you completed get crash, you can take your backup and restore.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2727.24" data-time-end="2739.12">
Suman Saha: that's how how flexible, so you never lost your data you never lost your application never lost your configurations so that's the benefit of using virtualization.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2743.44" data-time-end="2754.51">Suman Saha: But so secure very easily portable not dependent on physical servers that is a virtual machine image which is portable with just like a file.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2759.49" data-time-end="2764.8">Suman Saha: OK, so now give me some links that you know.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2766.18" data-time-end="2777.28">Suman Saha: how you can install your virtual machines on your computers, so we get all the links, so how to download virtual box, you see lingo over here.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2778.03" data-time-end="2792.73">Suman Saha: Then, after installing virtual box you download Linux that is one to 20.0 for free, there is a link and how to install that one we also gave the link for installation video.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2793.66" data-time-end="2803.8">Suman Saha: for students who have MAC computers, with a am on chip which doesn't allow another virtual machines, they should try you try.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2804.67" data-time-end="2818.29">Suman Saha: So you DM is virtual machine for MAC computers, so it is designed for MAC computers, so you can try, you know you try, if you have amongst your otherwise you can use virtual box.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2819.19" data-time-end="2825.55">Suman Saha: As I said before, if you already have something as a virtual machines you don't need to install again.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2826.54" data-time-end="2841.24">Suman Saha: But if you don't have we prefer you use virtual box because it's so easy to use it's so easy to install okay all the detailed instructions over here i'll show you some slides i'll show you how easy to install those things.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2853.81" data-time-end="2870.85">Suman Saha: You see, that when you download your virtual box, it will show you some welcome screen, then you click continue, and it will have the install button you click install it looks for password get the password of your computers and then you have done.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2872.74" data-time-end="2875.32">Suman Saha: Okay, so this is so after.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2876.46" data-time-end="2882.91">Suman Saha: After installations, you have this page can hear you can hear different operating systems.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2884.08" data-time-end="2885.58">Suman Saha: Different but formation so buddy.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2886.99" data-time-end="2887.38">Suman Saha: Okay.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2890.08" data-time-end="2890.86">Suman Saha: Thank you.</span> <span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2900.01" data-time-end="2904.99">Suman Saha: Everyone should we should you eat yep we don't have to use virtual box right Okay, thank you.</span></div>
