## Pointers

• type *name; // declare a pointer
• type *name = address; // declare + initialize a pointer
• a pointer is a variable that contains a memory address
• Source of confusion: *p vs p – the pointer variable is just p, without *

int* p1;

int *p2; // preferred

int* p1, p2; // bug?; equivalent to int *p1; int p2;

int* p1, * p2; // correct

or

int *p1, *p2; // correct, preferred (generally)

## Double Pointers

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/double-pointer-pointer-pointer-c/

int \*\*ptr;    // declaring double pointers

## Dereferencing Pointers

• dereference: access the memory referred to by a pointer
• *pointer // dereference a pointer
• *pointer is an alias for the variable pointer points to
• *pointer = value; // dereference / assign
• pointer-p = pointer-q; // pointer assignment

## Pointers as Return Values

• Okay to return passed in pointer (or dynamically allocated memory)
• NOT OKAY TO RETURN THE ADDRESS OF A LOCAL Variable

## Variable Storage Classes

• C (and other languages) have several storage classes that are defined by their scopes

• **auto** – these are automatically allocated and deallocated variables (local function variables declared on stack)

• **global** – globally defined variables that can be accessed anywhere within the program
	• keyword extern is used in .c/.h files to indicate a variable defined elsewhere
• **static** – a variable that is global to the local file only (static global variable) or to the scope of a function (static local variable)

• keyword static is used to identify variable as local only

• global: declared outside of any function (without any keyword)
	• accessible from anywhere within the same file
	• accessible in other files via extern keyword

• static: declared outside of any function with static keyword
	• prepending static to line 3 of main.c limits scope of x to main.c; compilation fails

----
• global and static variables:
	• initialized to supplied or default value before program execution begins
	• preserve changes until the end of program execution
• static variables can also appear within a function:
	• limits the scope to the function
	• unlike automatic variables, preserves changes across invocations

## Arrays

// Best approach to init all values

int val4[3] = { [0 … 2] = 1 };

`• type name[size] = {value, value, …, value};
	• allocates and array and fills it with supplied values
	• if fewer values are given than the array size, fills rest with 0
`• name[index] = <expression>
	• sets the value of an array element`

int primes[6] = {2, 3, 5, 6, 11, 13};

primes[3] = 7;

primes[100] = 0; // smash!

• type name[rows][columns] = {{values}, …, {values}};
	• allocates a 2D array and fills it with predefined values

## Systems Programming

### C

• integer types
• char, int
• floating point
• float, double
• modifiers
• short [int]
• long [int, double]
• signed [char, int]
• unsigned [char, int]
![[Pasted image 20220613172628.png]]

### const（永久）

	• a qualifier that indicates the variable’s value cannot change
	• compiler will issue an error if you try to violate this
	• why is this qualifier useful?

## Pass-by-value

## Pass-by-reference

## Very Different Than Java

	• Libraries you can count on
		• C has very few compared to most other languages
		• no built-in trees, hash tables, linked lists, sort , etc.
		• you have to write many things on your own
		• particularly data structures
		• error prone, tedious, hard to build efficiently and portably
		• less productive language than Java, C++, python, or others

也可以这样汇总
![[Pasted image 20220613183100.png]]

• When handling a pointer to a struct, the fields are accessed with the “->” operator instead of the “.”
