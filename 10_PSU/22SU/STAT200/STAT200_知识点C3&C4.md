# STAT200_知识点C3&C4

The definition of the complement of an event is the set of all outcomes in a sample space that are not included in an event E.

## Classical Probability, Empirical Probability, or Subjective Probability

Classical​ (or theoretical) probability is used when each outcome in a sample space is equally likely to occur. Empirical​ (or statistical) probability is based on observations obtained from probability experiments. Subjective probability results from​ intuition, educated​ guesses, and estimates.

## Discrete Probability Distribution

The expected value is the sum of the values for x multiplied by their respective probabilities. The expected value does not have to be equal to one of the possible values for x.

## Discrete Vs. Continuous Variables

If a [variable](https://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary?definition=Variable) can take on any value between two specified values, it is called a **continuous variable**; otherwise, it is called a **discrete variable**.

Some examples will clarify the difference between discrete and continuous variables.

- Suppose the fire department mandates that all fire fighters must weigh between 150 and 250 pounds. The weight of a fire fighter would be an example of a continuous variable; since a fire fighter's weight could take on any value between 150 and 250 pounds.
- Suppose we flip a coin and count the number of heads. The number of heads could be any integer value between 0 and plus infinity. However, it could not be any number between 0 and plus infinity. We could not, for example, get 2.5 heads. Therefore, the number of heads must be a discrete variable.

Just like variables, [probability distributions](https://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary?definition=Probability_distribution) can be classified as discrete or continuous.

## Discrete Probability Distributions

If a [random variable](https://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary?definition=Random_variable) is a discrete variable, its [probability distribution](https://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary?definition=Probability_distribution) is called a **discrete probability distribution**.

An example will make this clear. Suppose you flip a coin two times. This simple [statistical experiment](https://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary?definition=Statistical_experiment) can have four possible outcomes: HH, HT, TH, and TT. Now, let the random variable X represent the number of Heads that result from this experiment. The random variable X can only take on the values 0, 1, or 2, so it is a discrete random variable.
