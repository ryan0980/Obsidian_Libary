## An Observational Study and an Experiment

>In an experiment, a treatment is applied to part of a population and responses are observed. The researcher in an experiment deliberately influences the responses.
>In an observational study, a researcher measures characteristics of interest of a part of a population but does not change existing conditions. The researcher in an observational study does not influence the responses.

in experiment, 实验人员会做出行动并观察反应

in Observational Study, 观察人员只会观察

### A Placebo is a Fake Treatment Used in Experiments.

**安慰剂**

## Biased

不要有偏向

## Sum And Percentages

If percentages are used, the sum should be 100%. If proportions are used, the sum should be 1.

## Class Width

In a frequency distribution, the class width is the distance between the lower or upper limits of consecutive classes.

## Upper Class and Lower Class

### Midpoint

### Class Boundaries

## Frequency Table

0-39， 39/5=7.8~=8（round up)
然后作为lower class

Frequency =出现频率

Midpoint=(lower+upper)/2

Relative Frequency=Class Frequency \/ Sample Size

The **cumulative frequency** is the sum of the frequency for that class and all previous classes.

There are not yet any previous classes, so the cumulative frequency is 4.
