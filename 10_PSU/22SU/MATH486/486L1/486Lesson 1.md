## **Strategies In Extensive Form Games with Perfect Information**

A Strategy is a **Complete contingency plan** on how to play the game

one action player will made for each decision nodes

Player 1 have 3 strategy and Player 2 have 8 strategy

player 1 的 node 下面有3种选项，所以3个strategy， player 2 有3个弄得， 每个node下面2种选项，总共有8种排列，000，001到111
